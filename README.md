# Find the Best Karak: GitHub Copilot Tutorial

## Introduction

 In this tutorial, we will guide you step-by-step to create a website to display and rate the Karak restaurants in Qatar. You'll learn how to leverage GitHub Copilot to develop this website using HTML and JavaScript. By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll be able to create an engaging website that runs on your local PC.

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

* Visual Studio Code
  ```bash
  https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  ```
  
* GitHub account with access to GitHub Copilot.
  
  ```bash
  vscode://github.copilot-chat
  ```

## Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub to store your project files.

    ![Fork the repository on GitHub](./Assets/fork_repo.png)

2. Give a repository name and description.

6. If prompted to trust the authors, click on "Yes, I trust the authors".
   
## Development

### Task 1: Open GitHub Copilot Chat

1. Open the Copilot Edits view from the Command Center Copilot menu or press ```Ctrl+Shift+I```

2. Then drag and drop the karak.json file from Explorer tab to "Working Set" field on the Copilot panel.

> [!TIP]
> Use Copilot Edits to start an AI-powered code editing session and iterate quickly on code changes across multiple files by using natural language. Copilot Edits applies the edits directly in the editor, where you can review them in-place, with the full context of the surrounding code.

### Task 2: Ask GitHub Copilot to Create your workspace with neccessary files

1. Use your creativity to ask Copilot to create the necessary files for your project. You can provide a prompt that describes the website you want to build and the features you need. For example, you can ask Copilot to generate an HTML file with a heading, paragraph, input field, and submit button, as well as a JavaScript file to fetch clues from a JSON file.

   <details>
        <summary>Here is a good prompt that you can use.</summary>

         I'm creating a website called "Find the best Karak tea" using HTML and JavaScript. The website should display various restaurant names, description and images in the HTML page. You can find the titles, descriptions and images in karak.json. Please help me generate the basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS files needed for this website in the root folder. The HTML file will include a heading, a paragraph to display description, a star based rating system for the following properties: Taste, Ambience, Price, Fragrance and Overall rating.

   </details>
   &nbsp;

2. If everything goes well, GitHub Copilot will generate the necessary files in the "root" folder. Review the generated files and "Accept" the changes if they meet your requirements. If the generated content is not satisfactory, press "Discard" and refine your prompt to improve the results.

### Task 3: Test the Website

1. Open new terminal in VSCode from the Terminal menu on the top or press ```Ctrl+Shift+` ```.

    ![Open terminal](./Assets/image-7.png)

2. Then type ```http-server .```  to run the game in the browser.

   ![Terminal Output](./Assets/image-15.png)
   &nbsp;

> [!TIP]
> http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development and learning.

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:{port_number}/`. For example, if your port number is 8081, you would go to `http://localhost:8081/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You may need to update the `script.js` or `index.html` files to resolve any issues or to enhance the game's functionality.

### Task 4: Make changes to the website.

1. Return to Visual Studio Code and inspect the "Working Set" panel. You should see all the newly created files alongside `karak.json`. If they are not visible, drag and drop them from the Explorer window again.

   ![Working Set](./Assets/image-16.png)

2. Ask Copilot to change the rating criteria of Price to Value for Money.

   <details>
      <summary> Here is a good prompt that you can use </summary>

       Please change the rating criteria to "Taste, Fragrance, Ambience, Value for Money, and Overall rating"
   </details>
&nbsp;

3. GitHub Copilot will generate the necessary modifications to your project files. Review and accept the changes.

   ![Copilot response](./Assets/image-9.png)
   &nbsp;

4. Ask Copilot to display numerical values for the user ratings (for example, 4 out of 5).

<details>
      <summary> Here is a good prompt that you can use </summary>
 
       Please display the rating values when user selects a rating. For example, Taste: (4/5) when user selects 4 stars.
</details>
&nbsp;

5. Ask Copilot to enter their feedback for restaurants.

<details>
      <summary> Here is a good prompt that you can use </summary>
 
       provide an option for users to enter their feedback as text for each karak shop, and submit the feedback and ratings.
</details>
&nbsp;

6. Display a banner image for the website

<details>
      <summary> Here is a good prompt that you can use </summary>
 
       display a scrollable banner image in the website, using images from images/banner folder.
</details>
&nbsp;

### Task 5: Show the Images of places in a Gallery View

1. Ask Copilot to add a gallery view to display images of the locations.

   <details>
      <summary> Here is a good prompt that you can use </summary>

       I want to add a gallery view to my page. 
       Whenever a user finds the right answer I want to show the image of the place in the gallery. 
       You can find the image URLs of the locations in clues.json. 
       Please help me to add the gallery view to the page and show the images of the places in the gallery.
   </details>
   &nbsp;
2. GitHub Copilot will generate the necessary modifications to your project files. Review and accept the changes.
3. Test the application again. When the player enters the correct location, the game should display the image of the location in the gallery view. At the end of the game, all the images should be visible in the gallery. If application is not working as expected, review the code and make necessary changes with the help of Copilot.

### Task 6: Enhance the Application with Additional Features

1. We have incorporated the location name and a 5-star rating system for each location in the final solution. Now, it's your opportunity to showcase your creativity by adding extra features to your application. Consider the following enhancements:

   * Add a timer to challenge players to complete the game within a certain timeframe.
   * Enhance the user interface with animations and transitions for a more engaging experience.
   * Include sound effects and background music to make the game more immersive.

2. Use GitHub Copilot to assist you in implementing these features. Review and test the changes thoroughly to ensure they meet your requirements.

### Task 7: Commit and Push Changes

1. Once you are satisfied with the changes, save the files and end your GitHub Copilot edit session by clicking the "Done" button. Commit the changes to your local repository by clicking the source control button on the left panel of VSCode and entering a commit message.

   ![Commit changes](./Assets/image-10.png)

2. You can also use GitHub Copilot to generate a commit message with small magic button in the message box.

3. Sync the changes to your GitHub repository

   ![Push changes to GitHub](./Assets/image-12.png)

### Task 8: Share your Project

1. Share the link to your GitHub repository with friends and family to showcase your treasure hunt game
